        <h3>What makes mobile phones so important?</h3>
        <p>Phones and social media the way we do things, in this day and age, it's difficult to comprehend life without
            them. The treasured phone you have today, and those yet to come, provide a host of advantages, like
            connecting you to the globe and keeping you up to date on all the current affairs. Smartphones are, as the
            name implies, smart gadgets designed to make your life easier. Smartphones display the time, date, compute
            numbers, wake you up when you want them to, remind you of an important event, and locate you via GPS
            navigation. They include cameras so you may take photographs and record videos to save for later. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Impacts of technology</h3>
        <p>Techniques have the ability to make our planet a more equitable, peaceful, and just place. Each of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals – from ending extreme poverty to lowering maternal and infant mortality, supporting sustainable farming and decent employment, and reaching universal literacy – may be aided and accelerated by technological advancements. However, technology may also jeopardize privacy, weaken security, and exacerbate inequity. They have consequences for human rights and agency. We – governments, organizations, and individuals – have a choice in how we harness and handle new technology, just as previous generations did.</p>
        <br><p> It is essential to emphasize that historically, technological advancements have boosted productivity, resulted in continuous gains in living standards, and created more employment than they have eliminated. However, this success has been accompanied by a number of upheavals, particularly in the labor sector, particularly during the transition period. Indeed, technology has caused deep structural economic change, generating new employment and sectors while eliminating and changing others, with significant ramifications for some groups of people, particularly low-skilled employees.</p>
